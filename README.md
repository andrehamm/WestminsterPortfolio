Water Database
This was a group project for my Database Systems class. The purpose of this project was to create a database application. We chose to work with the Westminster Environmental center and create a desktop application for them to keep track of the schools water usage. We used MySQL and Java to develop our desktop app. 

This project involved a lot of collaboration and problem solving. We did not know much about software development so our biggest issue was collaborating on code and delegating apprpriate tasks to individuals.


Ski Math
This is a group project that I completed in Software Engineering. Our task was to develop a math or grammar game for 1st and 2nd graders. My group decided to develop a math game that was ski themed. The program would have two user groups, teachers and students. Students would be able to log on to their profile, play the game, and check their gameplay history. Teachers would be able to log on to their profiles, manage their classes, and view student progress. We decided to develop a web game using django as our web and database framework and unity as our game framework. I was in charge of using django to create and manage our database and web frameworks. One other group member was in charge of web layout, and the other two worked on getting the game up and running on unity. 

This was a great project. It gave me the opportunity to follow the Agile software Developement methodology, and work together with a team to create a runnable web program. This project involved a lot of problem solving, both individually and as a group. It gave me a strong base to work off of for future work.
